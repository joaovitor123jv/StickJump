# This will be... maybe a future GUI toolkit

Let's try \o/

## To compile, you'll need sdl2, sdl2-image, sdl2-ttf, g++ and make (if you want to have a simple build)

Then, run "make""
Ok, it's done, and now you can run it with "./play"


If your compositing system go down, don't worry... SDL do this, and you can block it by editing your window manager settings... 

Tested on Arch linux and Elementary OS Juno
